Node.js:

What is Node.js?

 Node.js is a platform to run js code outside web browser.
 Platform means collection of tools,libs/apis,runtime in order to build end to end apps

Why Node.js Was Created?

 Before Node.js, There was no arch for building application particullar networkbased apps using nonblocking /async programming model.

What is Blocking and What is Non Blocking(Async) Programming Model?

Runtime:
  The program which runs the code for eg : jvm
Every Runtime is a process.
Each has sub process called "Thread".
Thread executes code parallel, - multi task.
.....................................................................................
				 File Descriptors
.....................................................................................

1.File descriptors is simple array(ds)
2.File descriptor is associated with every process on os- if you run more than one process - will have more file descriptor table

 jvm---------> fd 
 browser-----> fd
 notepad ---> fd

fd is created when process is created, destroyed when process is destroyed...

FD arch:
Integer value	Name	<unistd.h> symbolic constant[1]	<stdio.h> file stream[2]
0	Standard input	STDIN_FILENO	stdin
1	Standard output	STDOUT_FILENO	stdout
2	Standard error	STDERR_FILENO	stderr

These values are standard which cant be altered.

Lets assume if you write a program to read data from the harddrive.

Process:
1.we use language high level api to start reading file from the disk
  java:
   FileInputStream fins= newFileInputStream("c:/tmp/version.txt")
   fins.read()

 java uses read api--------|jvm----will call c api(os api)---->kernal--fd

2.we use language high level api to start reading data from the network(Remote computer)
  java:
 java uses readSocket------i--------|jvm----will call c api(os api)---->kernal--fd

Network io and web server:

Any web server if you take, it works based on io model- socket-network io.

Traditional web server, for every client request is  handled inside server by a thread.

        "Request Per Thread model"

....................................................................................
Drawbacks of Request Per Thread Model.
   1000 req = 1000 thread
   1 million = 1 million threads


 c10k Problem
The C10k problem is the problem of optimizing network sockets to handle a large number of clients at the same time.[1] The name C10k is a numeronym for concurrently handling ten thousand connections

Solution: 
 =>How to reduce no of threads.

Evils of Thread:
 ->Thread is subject to memory.
 ->Thread is subject to cpu, cpu need to do lot of ctx switch.

Solution:
 Having  a limited no of threads , at least one or two.

Linux api to make non blocking io:

1.select + read
2.Poll
3.Epoll

EPoll:
  It is a framework, introduced in linux to handle non blocking operations using event driven programming model.

EPoll introduced a concept called "event loop"

Event Loop:

Any similar arch/technology available today like node.js?

Java - with Netty
Java with Vertx
Java with Quarkus

What type apps we can build using Node.js?

You can build  concurrent non blocking network io apps....
